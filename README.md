## 🎓 What I Learned

Through building this React practice project, I gained experience with:

- **Component-Based Architecture** - Breaking down UI into reusable components
- **JSX Syntax** - Writing HTML-like syntax within JavaScript
- **State Management** - Using React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Props Handling** - Passing data between components
- **Event Handling** - Managing user interactions
- **Responsive Design** - Creating mobile-friendly interfaces
- **Deployment** - Publishing React apps to GitHub Pages
- **Project Structure** - Organizing a React application effectively

## 🔧 Technical Skills Practiced
